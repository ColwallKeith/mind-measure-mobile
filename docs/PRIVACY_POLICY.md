## Data Minimization and Privacy by Design

### What We Collect
- **Only Essential Data**: We collect only the minimum data necessary for app functionality
- **Categorical Data**: Most health data is stored in broad categories (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") rather than precise scores
- **Time Granularity**: Timestamps are stored by week, not exact times

### What We Don't Store
- **Exact Responses**: Raw assessment answers are processed and summarized
- **Identifiable Audio**: Voice recordings are processed for analysis then immediately deleted
- **Detailed Timestamps**: Precise activity times are rounded to protect privacy

## University Data Sharing - Zero Individual Identification

### What Universities See

### Technical Safeguards
